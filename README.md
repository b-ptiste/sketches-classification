The aim of this work was to develop a model capable of classifying the images of the dataset classifysketch with the best accuracy. It is made up of 250 classes of sketches. I fine-tuned model from timm library ðŸ¤—. I improved the performance using data augmentation. It enabled me to achieve 82.8% accuracy on the test dataset using results from [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)], [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10270)], and a new data augmentation :

* Implementation of Cut-mix, Mix-up 
* New domain specific augmentation : **Line width augmentation**
